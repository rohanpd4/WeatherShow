# WeatherShow
WeatherShow is an android application which shows the weather of the designated city.
It is just a  simple project just to expand my knowledge on API Parsing.
It uses openweatherapi for providing the weather reports.


# System Requirements:

1.Android Studio - above 2.7

2.Emulator with API atleast 18.(If want to run in the Emulator)

As of now UI is not upto the point. In the coming versions it will be powered by MaterialUI and more features will be added like notifiers etc..
